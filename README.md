# The Project: Code Quiz Challenge

*GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

*WHEN I click the start button

*THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

*WHEN I answer a question

*THEN I am presented with another question

*WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

*THEN time is subtracted from the clock

*WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

*THEN the game is over

*WHEN the game is overJ

Above is the criteria for the code quiz this weeks assignment was to create the code from scratch and this may seem amazing to show creativity it still had requirements for functioning which was the most challenging part of the assignment. The assignment tested our ability to create functions that would meet the above criteria and also create the elements that the functions would control. What I mean by that is we had to create the HTML elements and then make them function correctly for the assignment. It was very challenging to complete this assignment we were given a gif and had to use that as a guide to our entire assignment my only issue with that is I could not pause the gif to analyze certain elements of the functioning webpage. If there was a way to pause the gif that would have been a good piece of information to share. 

# Lessons:

The lessons that I have learned from this assignment were infinite each assignment shows us particular elements that we will strengthen and struggle with that is the point of the assignment. I learned that it takes alot to build what looks like a simple webpage the code behind the webpage is what drives it and I have been noticing how complex that can get very quickly. The javascript file is around 200 lines to allow for the functioning of the assignment. Minimal HTML facets are involved in this particular assignment but the bulk of it was the functions and how they made the HTML work to meet the criteria given. 

# Takaways: 

The takaways from this assignment is a much better knowledge of Java and how it is so imperitive to make the webpage complex. Its functions create so much and do so much but they can also be messed up very easily with a simple wrong {} or a misplaced ; it all boils down to the context and following the rules of the language. I would not be able to complete this assignment without the extensive reserch that come along with each assignment. The knowledge that I have gained so far is limitless and I never knew how hard and complex it would become but I am happy and willing to keep learning how to build on the simple concepts we have already learned.
